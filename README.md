# Project 1: Golf Analysis Project 1 
This analysis serves to explore historical PGA data from 2010-2018 that was collected from the PGA Tour website. I am new to using Python for data analysis and wanted to practice on data I am genuinely curious in. I also wanted to see whether putting had a bigger impact on score/winnings than driving.
